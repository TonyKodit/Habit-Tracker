# Habit Logger

 This is an application where you’ll register one habit. This habit can't be tracked by time (ex. hours of sleep), only by quantity (ex. number of water glasses a day)

## Given Requirements

- When the application starts, it should create a sqlite database, if one isn’t present.
- It should also create a table in the database, where the habit will be logged.
-  The app should show the user a menu of options.

-   The users should be able to insert, delete, update and view their logged habit.
- You should handle all possible errors so that the application never crashes.
- The application should only be terminated when the user inserts 0.
-   You can only interact with the database using raw SQL. You can’t use mappers such as Entity Framework.
